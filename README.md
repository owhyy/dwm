# dwm - dynamic window manager
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

## Requirements
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

## Configuration
Edit `config.h` and run `make clean install` (as root, if needed)

## Patches
- actualfullscreen
- swallow
- vanitygaps (with ctags and layouts)

## Keybindings
I have keybings for some of the ThinkPad fn key. You can see them and the rest of keybindings in `config.h`.
